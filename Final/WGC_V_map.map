  Number of Slice LUTs:                         10 out of  80,000    1%
    Number used as logic:                       10 out of  80,000    1%
      Number using O6 output only:               6
      Number using O5 output only:               0
      Number using O5 and O6:                    4
      Number used as ROM:                        0
    Number used as Memory:                       0 out of  27,840    0%
    Number used exclusively as route-thrus:      0

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                     8 out of  20,000    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:           11
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:             1 out of      11    9%
    Number with an unused LUT:                   1 out of      11    9%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:           9 out of      11   81%
    Number of unique control sets:               3
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              18 out of 160,000    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.
