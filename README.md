# AES-IP-SOC
An AES-Based Intellectual-Property Identification in System-on-a-Chip (SOC) Design.

A novel intellectual-property (IP) identification using System-on-a-Chip (SOC) watermarking scheme. An efficient and a novel principle are established for IP identification which depends on the current IP design flow. The principle is embedding different Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) encoders in to a System-on-a-Chip (SOC) based watermarking scheme at behavior design level. This method is efficient as it survives synthesis, placement, and routing and can identify the IP at various levels. It may be easy to detect the identification of the provider even after the chip has been manufactured. The proposed method increases security for the System-on-a-Chip (SOC) based IP identification and protection scheme.

This watermarking scheme was synthesized using the Xilinx ISE 13.2. The entire soft IP was implemented in a Virtex 6 FPGA. The IP core and the AES algorithms are written in VHDL.
